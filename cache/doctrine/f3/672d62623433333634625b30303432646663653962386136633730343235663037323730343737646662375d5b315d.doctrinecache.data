a:2:{s:7:"content";s:4167:"<p>I've put together a little post to introduce you to the Notpead theme and get you started with Markdown. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn how it all works!</p>
<h1>ELEMENTS</h1>
<p>Writing in markdown is really easy. In any editor like notepad, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use formatting shortcuts to style your content. </p>
<h2>LISTS</h2>
<p>For example, a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul>
<li>A nested item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>
<p>or with numbers!</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk</li>
<li>Drink the milk</li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>
<h2>LINKS</h2>
<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you put the url in this format, like <code>[http://getgrav.org/](http://getgrav.org/)</code> - it'll automatically be linked up like <a href="http://getgrav.org/">http://getgrav.org/</a>. But if you want to customize your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to the <a href="http://getgrav.org/" title="Grav Website">my website</a>. Neat.</p>
<h2>WHAT ABOUT IMAGES?</h2>
<p>Images work too! And they are responsive! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Images are responsive and uses lightbox. </p>
<p><img alt="Photo16" src="/user/pages/blog/2014-01-10-theme-elements/photo16.jpg" />
<img alt="Photo13" src="/user/pages/blog/2014-01-10-theme-elements/photo13.jpg" />
<img alt="Photo19" src="/user/pages/blog/2014-01-10-theme-elements/photo19.jpg" /></p>
<p>Check out [this post]({{ base_url_absolute }}/articles/sample-post-images/) to learn about including images in your post.</p>
<h2>AND VIDEOS?</h2>
<p>Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVids</a>.</p>
<h2>EQUATIONS</h2>
<p>Are you an engineer? Or a mathematician? Want to post some equations in your Grav blog for the world to see? No problem. Wrapping your equation between <code>$$...$$</code> will produce something like this:</p>
<math display="block">
  <mstyle>
    <mi>f</mi>
    <mrow>
      <mo>(</mo>
      <mi>a</mi>
      <mo>)</mo>
    </mrow>
    <mo>=</mo>
 <mfrac>
        <mn>1</mn>
        <mrow>
          <mn>2</mn>
          <mi>π<!-- π --></mi>
          <mi>i</mi>
        </mrow>
      </mfrac>
    <msub>
      <mo>∮</mo>
      <mrow>
        <mi>γ</mi>
      </mrow>
    </msub>
    <mfrac>
      <mrow>
        <mi>f</mi>
        <mo>(</mo>
        <mi>z</mi>
        <mo>)</mo>
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        <mi>z</mi>
        <mo>−</mo>
        <mi>a</mi>
      </mrow>
    </mfrac>
    <mi>d</mi>
    <mi>z</mi>
  </mstyle>
</math>
<h2>THE LOGO</h2>
<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and change the image in the user/config/site.yml.</p>
<h2>ICONS</h2>
<p>This theme includes over 360 fontawesome icons. To use an icon go to <a href="http://fontawesome.io/3.2.1/icons/">Fontawesome</a> website and click on the desired icon to find the appropriate tag.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<i class="icon-cogs"></i> <i class="icon-youtube-sign"></i> <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i> <i class="icon-coffee"></i> <i class="icon-cloud-upload"></i> <i class="icon-camera"></i> <i class="icon-comments-alt"></i> <i class="icon-eye-open"></i> <i class="icon-heart"></i> <i class="icon-globe"></i>
</div>
<h2>QUOTING</h2>
<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when I introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.
<small><cite title="Hossain Mohd Faysal">Hossain Mohd Faysal</cite></small></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>READY FOR A BREAK?</h2>
<p>Throw 4 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>
<hr />
<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think <a href="https://twitter.com/getgrav">@getgrav</a>.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
