>&quot;The cold harsh reality is that we have to balance the budget. &quot;

"But I don't want to budget! Sticking to a budget is such a chore! Entering all my transactions is so hard!" Yeah, that's a tough one. But you know what is even harder? Being hopelessly, desperately poor.

You think that's hard? Then try being hopelessly, desperately poor and then finding out your car transmission is shot. Or that your kid broke his arm and had an ER trip. Or that your roof is leaking.

Here's the thing: you've already lost. You don't earn enough money to be able to just say "screw it, I'll buy whatever I want and it'll be fine." You absolute failure!

So given that you're already a huge loser, your best chance is to do what you can with what you do have. That means taking whatever pitiful income you earn and not being an idiot about how you spend it.

## Step 1: Figure out what you want

Before you know what to do, you need to know what you're trying to accomplish. This is not rocket science, so bear with me. Here are some leading questions that could get you started.

- Do you want to retire? (If you say no to this then you can stop reading because I don't know how to help you.)
- At what age? Keep in mind the part about how you're a huge loser and make this a realistic number.
- How much money do you want to have at retirement?
- Do you have kids or want to have kids?
- Do you want to be able to pay for them to go to college?
- What super expensive and obnoxious hobbies do you want to be able to afford?

Basically, what is your definition of "oh crap, I'm actually doing pretty good with money now?" Whatever that is, make that your goal.

## Step 2: Assess the situation

Think for a second about the past month and ask yourself two questions:

1. How much money did you earn? If you're like most people, you should know the answer to that one almost down to the penny.
2. What did you spend it on? If you're like most people, you have absolutely no idea.

You probably can roughly estimate what percentage of it went to things like mortgage and utilities - that's the easy part. But take a crack at how much you spent on groceries, restaurants, clothes, other shopping, all that crap. Estimate all of that and add it all together, and I bet you'll be way below what you earned, meaning you're spending more than you think.

So given that you're a failure when it comes to earning loads of money AND you have no idea where the money that you *do* earn is going, step one is to figure that out.

This is the easiest step, so you really have no good excuse not to do it. Download any of the bajillions of mobile apps for tracking your spending, and use it consistently for a full month. That means entering an amount and category for everything you spend money on, from your mortgage all the way to a pack of gum.
